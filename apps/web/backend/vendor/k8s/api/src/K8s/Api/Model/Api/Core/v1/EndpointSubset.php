/**
 * EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of endpoints is
 * the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:
 *
 * 	{
 * 	  Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.1.1"}, {"ip": "10.10.2.2"}],
 * 	  Ports:     [{"name": "a", "port": 8675}, {"name": "b", "port": 309}]
 * 	}
 *
 * The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:
 *
 * 	a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],
 * 	b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]
