 * Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster. It generally denotes some state change in

 * Event consumers should not rely on the timing of an event with a given Reason reflecting a
 * consistent underlying trigger, or the continued existence of events with that Reason.  Events should
 * be treated as informative, best-effort, supplemental data.
