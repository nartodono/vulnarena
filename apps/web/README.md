# Vulnarena Web Application

This directory contains the source code for Vulnarena's main web application, using a decoupled architecture.  
The `frontend` serves as the user-facing server, built mainly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with PHP used for routing and some server-side functionality.  
The `backend` functions as an API service, responsible for all data processing and business logic.

## Structure

- `frontend/` — Source code for the website's frontend, which is accessed by users.
- `backend/` — Source code for the backend API, responsible for all data processing and business logic.
- `database/` — Contains the MySQL database schema (`.sql` file) with all tables and columns required by the web application.  
  _Note: The database folder only provides the schema; it does not contain any actual data._
