# Vulnarena

**Vulnarena** is a prototype website designed as an educational cybersecurity platform.  
It provides comprehensive learning materials along with post-tests to assess users' knowledge, followed by dynamic, intentionally vulnerable labs so users can practice real-world scenariosâ€”not just theory.

Vulnarena also features a unique PvP Quiz mode, allowing two users to compete head-to-head in a cybersecurity quiz experience inspired by Kahoot, but with our own twist.
